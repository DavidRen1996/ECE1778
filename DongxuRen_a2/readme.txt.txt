The app profile page has three buttons, camera button for taking photoes,signout button for signning out account
and show button for loading image to the view. 
During my test, it takes three times to show the image.
Clicking any photo in the view can show the photo in full screen. All photoes and user information are stored
in firebase backend,deleting the app will not influence the firebase storage.
